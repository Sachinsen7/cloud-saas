## Data Flow Patterns

### Image Processing Flow
```
User → Upload Image → Client Validation → API Route → 
Clerk Auth → Cloudinary Upload → AI Processing → 
Database Storage → Response → User Display
```

### Facial Analysis Flow
```
User → Upload Image → API Route → Cloudinary Upload (with adv_face) → 
Azure AI Analysis → Extract Face Data → Generate Transformations → 
Database Storage → Response → User Display
```

### Document Conversion Flow
```
User → Upload Document → API Route → Cloudinary Upload (raw_convert: aspose) → 
Database (status: pending) → Aspose Processing (async) → 
Webhook Callback → Database Update (status: complete) → 
User Refresh → Display PDF
```

### AI Vision Flow
```
User → Define Parameters (tags/questions/prompts) → Upload Image → 
API Route → Cloudinary AI Vision API → LLM Analysis → 
Token Tracking → Database Update → Response → User Display
```

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Serverless Architecture**: Next.js API routes for auto-scaling
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout with Prisma generated types
3. **Authentication**: Clerk for complete auth solution
4. **Media Storage**: Cloudinary for CDN and transformations
5. **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSON fields for flexible AI data
6. **Error Handling**: Try-catch with proper HTTP status codes
7. **Security**: Middleware-based route protection, signed URLs
8. **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, CDN delivery
